# Do Artifacts have politics

tech can embody power & authority (not only judged for benefits/consequences & efficacy)
technology: authoritarian (powerful but unstable e.g nuclear) or democratic (weak but resourceful and durable e.g solar)
lots of tech has been called democratic (e.g soylent), maybe every has been heralded as salvation of free society

discovering virtues or evils in steel, plastic: mystifies human wrong, incorrectly assigns blame for oppression (blaming the hardware)
what matters is not tech but system it inhabits -> social determination of technology
technological determinism: tech is developed as a result of an internal dynamic & isn’t influenced by society but molds society

—
does above mean tech things don’t matter (only creators, society in which it was created, social determination of tech ~ social determination of taxation), tech isn’t special?

technological politics: certain tech as political phenomena in their own right ( pays attention to technical characteristics)

How can artifacts contain political properties?

Politics: arrangement of power and authority in humanity & the activities that take place under that

1. technical device or system settles an  issue in community
2. inherently political tech: appear to require / strongly compatible with particular kinds of political relationships 

technical device or system settles an  issue in community

mostly we look at details of form in tech as innocuous (e.g roads & overpasses)
(Robert moses) BUT low-hanging overpasses in Long Island: built to avoid buses -> social bias and racial prejudice (people who used public transit i.e. poor people & blacks couldn’t use)
many public works, city planning, architecture contain implicit / explicit political purposes 
- buildings to diffuse student demonstrations, stop street fighting 
- we think tech has been traditionally created to achieve efficiency (not the case)
- tech expresses human motives which can be bad (to have dominion over others)
- tech has been created to take humans places to destroy unions 
- tech history & american politics have been deeply intertwined 

Shouldn’t only judge and inspect how tech is USED but how it’s designed and created (what are the logical consequences before it precedes any use). Should pay attention to design & arrangements
- BUT there is a dif btw neglect & active intention (buses & disabled people)
- Somewhere between intended & unintended 

mechanical tomato harvesters -> reduced costs, increased product but drastically reduced number of tomato growers
efficiency > equity (in research, scientific knowledge, invention, corporate profit)

when dealing w/ tech change, two kinds of choices that reflect distribution of power, authority & privilege:
- yes / no: are we making & adopting or not
- specific features in design & arrangement (e.g addition of electronic sorters in tomato harvester affects balance of wealth and power)
- seemingly innocuous design masks social choices of profound significance 

tech is our way of building order. have dif ways of ordering human activity. deliberately / consciously or not, tech is chosen that influences human actions, dif people have dif & unequal degrees of power and awareness in structural decisions are made 
choices are fixed in material equipment. hard to change after initial commitments (like laws or political foundings) so we must attention to rules roles and relationships of politics to tech production / distribution / new machines

inherently political tech
- adoption of a given technical system *unavoidably* brings w/ it conditions for human relationships that have a political cast: oppressive / liberating
- tech w/ no flexibility, to choose them is to choose a political side 
friedrich engels: “On authority”
- e.g automatic machinery of a big factory forces workers to adhere to a regular work schedule, material condition imposes relationships of authority & subordination 
- unavoidable authoriatatism are deeply implanted in human involvement with science & tech 
- e.g ships, sailors yield to captain’s commands, cause sailing vessels need to be steered w/a firm hand (ships can’t be ran democratically)
- justifying authority on the basis of necessary conditions of technical practice (e.g plato)
- will increasing mechanization render obsolete the hierarchical division of labor & relationships of subordination (marx) -> proletarian revolution?
- or make it worse by converting the workman into a living appendage of the machine 
- what does modern tech make possible or necessary in political life
- Two modes: 
- 1. adoption of a technical system requires adherence to a set of social conditions, eg requirements for a nuclear power plant 
- 2. Technology is strictly compatible with an ideal (solar - more compatible with democracy cause it’s decentralizing and can be more widely distributed)
- also difference between external and internal to the workings of a system 
- what’s the difference? 
- dif btw patterns imposed by creators or governing bodies and patterns gotten from properties in the things themselves
- Eg atom bomb demands strict rigid centralized hierarchical chain of command 
- did tech like the railroad require a specific structure of human association or could it have been designed some other way? 
- political reasons rather than economic or societal for being against a tech (even though isn’t economics politics?)
- examples in europe of other conceivable arrangements of power & authority (decentralized, democratic, worker self management) for managing innovative technology SO does any tech *require* a certain structure of human association
- typically claims/ reasons of practical necessity (needed to maintain tech systems and have them work smoothly) eclipse moral & political reasoning: “this is just how things work” or the “sacrifice of innovation”
- an attempt to separate politics from practical necessity in tech systems: internal workings of tech systems can be separated from polity as a whole (what happens in industrial corps has little bearing on public institutions and society at large) -> “democracy stops at the factory gates” 
- BUT work is so embedded into life, if democracy doesn’t work for a factory how is it meant to work for a government 
- some people believe government should operate more like factories
- cases like nuclear power where it def influences quality of public life 
- even though sometimes in tech systems nothing is required on the onset, once a course of action is underway, the kinds of reasoning that justify adapting social life  to technical requirements pop up. 

Summary
— 
1. specific features in design or arrangement of device or system could provide convenient means of establishing patterns of power or authority (but this tech has flexibility so must be understood in context of society’s influence )
2. properties of certain tech are strongly / unavoidably linked (intractable) to particular institutional patterns of power & authority, no adjustments to tech would make a significant difference and no intervention by social systems 
3. while there is potential for renewable systems to be democratic we have to pay attention to how it’s built & nuclear power is inherently politically bad
 
# Artist talk: Additivism, Digital Colonalism and ...

[Notes](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Week-1-Morehshin-Artist-Talk-ZgnApxafIv3TXsKKm5IFI)

Donna Haraway: "It matters which stories tell stories..."

How can you use technology in a more provocative way?

- additive (a collective) + activism = additivism ( a call to arms )
- radicalism without violence ?
- oil as the 'lubricant' of historical and political narratives
- historical colonialism & imperialism & white savior bs: california ideology, saving the global cultural heritage
- what does it mean when the uk revives artifacts they had help in destroying (and keeping it in a uk museum). artifact that isis destroyed
- make profit off digital ownership of artifacts that originally were not theirs (e.g assyrian collection of british museum)
- need to be shared openly
- reminds me of Elan Mastai: All our wrong todays

"When you invent a new technology, you also invent the accident of that technology. What can go right and what can go wrong. There is no intimacy without consequence."
Accidents, intentions and neglect.
making invisible visible

- notions of monstrousity and feminism
- building archives (and focusing on what isn't represented) 
- imagining a new future
- macroactions -> macroinfluences (!!!)
- piece becoming a platform (for discussion)
